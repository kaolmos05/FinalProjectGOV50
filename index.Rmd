## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related the relationship between public school quality and voter turnout. I plan on investigating this relationship by looking at factors that indicate quality of education such as class sizes and funding per pupil by zipcode/neighborhood depending on the scale of this question and determining whether the quality of public schooing affects voter turnout.
